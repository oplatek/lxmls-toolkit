Deep learning remarks (Yoshua Bengio)
=====================================
- **deep learning is really good at estimating priors**
- meta learning is starting
    - previously bayesian
        - because it needs few examples
    - now NN because they can be pretrained from other similar task
- Things to focus on:
    - reinforcement learning (ok)
    - memory (todo)
        - neural memories (TODO article from DeepMind)
- Videos have description of the scenes for blind people - ?DVS?
    - learn about dialogue from it?
        

Tools
-----
- Theano
    - now better debugging?
